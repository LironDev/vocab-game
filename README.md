## Speech Features

The game includes advanced text-to-speech capabilities:

- **Smart Voice Selection**: Automatically finds the best available voice for each language
- **Google Voice Priority**: Prefers Google voices when available, falls back to system voices
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on desktop browsers and mobile devices (including Android)
- **Configurable Speed**: Speech rate can be adjusted (currently set to 80% of normal speed for better learning)
- **Language Detection**: Automatically selects appropriate voice based on the word's language

### Voice Selection Logic:
1. First tries to find a Google voice for the language
2. If no Google voice is available, selects the first available voice for that language
3. Falls back to English if no voice is found for the target language

## Vocabulary Files

### English/Hebrew (words-en.csv)
The file should be in the `public` folder with UTF-8 encoding and headers: `English,Hebrew`

Example:
```csv
English,Hebrew
cat,×—×ª×•×œ
dog,×›×œ×‘
sun,×©×ž×©
```

### Japanese (words-jp.csv)
The file should be in the `public` folder with UTF-8 encoding and headers: `Japanese,English,Hebrew`

Example:
```csv
Japanese,English,Hebrew
çŒ«,cat,×—×ª×•×œ
çŠ¬,dog,×›×œ×‘
å¤ªé™½,sun,×©×ž×©
```

**Important Notes:**
- Files must be in the `public` folder of the project
- Use UTF-8 encoding to support Hebrew and Japanese characters
- Column headers must match exactly: `English,Hebrew` for words-en.csv and `Japanese,English,Hebrew` for words-jp.csv
- The code loads files using: `fetch(\`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/words-en.csv\`)` for English and `fetch(\`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/words-jp.csv\`)` for Japanese
